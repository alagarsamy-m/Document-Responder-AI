# Using Local llama3:8b Model with Ollama in Your Project

## Overview
This document explains how to use your locally downloaded llama3:8b model with Ollama in your project for easy bundling and shipping.

## Steps to Bundle the Model

1. **Locate Your Local Model Files**  
   Find the directory where your llama3:8b model files are stored on your local machine. This is typically managed by Ollama or your model management system.

2. **Copy Model Files to Project Folder**  
   Create a folder named `models` (or any preferred name) inside your project directory.  
   Copy the entire llama3:8b model folder into this `models` directory.

3. **Configure Ollama to Use Local Model Path**  
   Ollama CLI or API allows specifying a local model path.  
   When initializing the Ollama model in your code, specify the model path or name accordingly.  
   Example in Python (using langchain_community.llms.Ollama):  
   ```python
   from langchain_community.llms import Ollama

   # Use the local model by specifying the model name or path
   llm = Ollama(model="llama3:8b", model_path="./models/llama3-8b")
   ```

   Adjust the `model_path` parameter to point to the local model directory inside your project.

4. **Ensure Model Files Are Included in Deployment**  
   When packaging or shipping your project, include the `models` directory with the llama3:8b files.  
   This ensures the model is available locally without requiring re-download.

## Notes

- The exact method to specify local model paths may vary depending on Ollama's version and API.  
- Consult Ollama's official documentation for the latest options on local model usage.  
- Using local models improves response time and avoids network dependency.

## Summary

- Copy your local llama3:8b model files into your project folder (e.g., `models/llama3-8b`).  
- Configure Ollama in your code to use the local model path.  
- Include the model files when distributing your project.

This setup allows easy bundling and shipping of your AI system with the local llama3:8b model.
